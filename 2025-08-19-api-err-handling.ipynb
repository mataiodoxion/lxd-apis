    "üìò Lesson: Error Handling with `try`, `throw`, and `catch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "Students will understand how JavaScript handles errors using `try`, `throw`, and `catch`, and why this is important when writing reliable programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Error Handling Matters:\n",
    "When code runs, things can go wrong:\n",
    "- A user enters the wrong input.\n",
    "- Data from an API is missing or corrupted.\n",
    "- A calculation doesn‚Äôt make sense (like dividing by 0).\n",
    "Without error handling, the program might crash completely. With error handling, we can catch problems and respond safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Three Parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. try\n",
    "- The ‚Äútest zone.‚Äù\n",
    "- Put code here that might cause an error.\n",
    "- If everything works, the program continues normally.\n",
    "- If something fails, it jumps straight to the catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try {\n",
    "  let x = JSON.parse(\"oops\"); // invalid JSON\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. throw\n",
    "- The ‚Äúsignal flare.‚Äù\n",
    "- Lets you create your own errors on purpose.\n",
    "- Use when you detect something wrong in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try {\n",
    "  let age = -3;\n",
    "  if (age < 0) {\n",
    "    throw \"Age cannot be negative!\";\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. catch\n",
    "- The ‚Äúsafety net.‚Äù\n",
    "- Runs only if an error happened in the try.\n",
    "- Gives you a chance to explain or fix the issue instead of crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try {\n",
    "  throw \"Something went wrong!\";\n",
    "} catch (error) {\n",
    "  console.log(\"Error caught:\", error);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "All Together:\n",
    "try {\n",
    "  let userInput = \"not-a-number\";\n",
    "  let number = Number(userInput);\n",
    "\n",
    "  if (isNaN(number)) {\n",
    "    throw \"Invalid number input!\";\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  console.log(\"Valid number:\", number);\n",
    "} catch (err) {\n",
    "  console.log(\"Oops, error:\", err);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- try ‚Üí test code that might fail.\n",
    "- throw ‚Üí create or signal an error.\n",
    "- catch ‚Üí handle the error safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps programs from crashing and helps you control what happens when something goes wrong.\n"
